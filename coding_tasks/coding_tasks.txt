Coding tasks: Write a program to:

1) Recursively find all FASTQ files in a directory and report each file name and
the percent of sequences in that file that are greater than 30 nt long.

2) Given a FASTA file with DNA sequences, find 10 most frequent sequences and
return the sequence and their counts in the file.

3) Given coordinates and a chromosome, write a program for looking up it's
annotation.  Keep in mind you'll be doing this annotation millions of times.
	- Input: 
		- Tab-delimited file: Chr<tab>Position
		- GTF formatted file with genome annotations.
	- Output: 
		- Annotated file of gene name that input position overlaps.
	- Hint: Most of these reads come from a small portion of the genome. Try to use this
		information to improve performance, if possible.



NOTE:
	- Sample input files have been provided for each task.
	- Please make sure each task can run on the command line.
	- In the spirit of assessing your programming abilities, please avoid using 3rd-party
tools to solve these problems (parsers and formatters excluded).
